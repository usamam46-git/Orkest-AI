"""
modules/executions/service.py — Business logic for workflow execution.

Layering: service calls repository; routers call service only.
organization_id always comes from the authenticated JWT context — never a
request body.

Business rules enforced here:
1. A run can only be created against a workflow with a published version
   (current_version_id IS NOT NULL). Attempting to run an unpublished
   workflow raises HTTP 422.
2. A run can only be resumed when its status is waiting_approval.
3. Approved resumes enqueue a Celery task; rejected resumes are resolved
   here immediately (no graph execution — the run is terminal).
4. FUTURE: per-node approver assignment is not implemented here.
   Any org member with execution:approve can resume any waiting run in the org.

    Three properties worth not regressing:

    - **The timestamp is inside the signed material.** Signing the body alone
      would let an attacker replay a captured request forever; binding the
      timestamp means changing it invalidates the signature, so the freshness
      window is actually enforced rather than advisory.
    - **`raw_body`, not the parsed JSON.** Re-serializing parsed JSON changes
      key order and whitespace, so the bytes signed by the caller and the bytes
      hashed here would differ. This is why the router reads `await
      request.body()` instead of taking a Pydantic model.
    - **`hmac.compare_digest`, never `==`.** Byte-by-byte comparison leaks the
      correct prefix through timing.

    A None secret (no such workflow, wrong trigger type, or none generated yet)
    still runs the full HMAC against a random throwaway key so the miss costs
    the same wall-clock time as a mismatch.
