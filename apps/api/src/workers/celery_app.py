"""
workers/celery_app.py — Celery application configuration.

Queue topology (Vol. 2 §5.1):
  workflow_execution  — LLM-latency-bound graph runs (concurrency=4, prefetch=1)
  document_processing — knowledge-base ingestion (concurrency=8, prefetch=2)
  notifications       — outbound notification delivery (concurrency=4)
  dead_letter         — tasks that exhausted all retries

document_processing went live 2026-08-15 with knowledge-base ingestion, and
notifications on 2026-08-23 with the `notify` tool type. **All three worker
containers now have a non-empty task registry**; the beat tick stays routed to
workflow_execution, which is now a choice (a short DB query does not warrant its
own container) rather than the necessity it was when the other two queues had no
consumers.

Beat: one periodic entry, `dispatch-due-schedules` (added 2026-08-09), which
drives cron-triggered workflows. See workers/trigger_tasks.py.
