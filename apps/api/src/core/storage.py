core/storage.py — object storage for knowledge-base documents (MinIO locally, AWS S3 in production).

Lives in `core/` rather than in `modules/knowledge_base/` for the same reason
`llm_client.py` and `encryption.py` do: it is an infrastructure client that owns
no tables and no routes, and the module convention (`models`/`schemas`/
`repository`/`service`/`router`) has no slot for one.

Until 2026-08-15 this file did not exist. The `minio` service has been running
in `infra/docker-compose.yml` since the initial commit, `boto3` has been a
declared dependency just as long, and `MINIO_*` settings sit in `core/config.py`
— with **no client code anywhere**. This is the first consumer.

## Sync client, two call styles

`boto3` is synchronous and has no async variant worth adopting. The two callers
want opposite things, so both are provided:

- the FastAPI upload path uses the `await`-able wrappers, which hand the blocking
  call to a worker thread — a multi-megabyte PUT on the event loop would stall
  every other request in the process for its duration;
- the Celery ingestion task calls the plain `*_sync` functions directly, because
  it is already running inside its own thread with nothing to starve.

Both share one client. `boto3.client` is documented as thread-safe once
constructed (resources are not), which is what makes a module-level singleton
correct here rather than merely convenient.
